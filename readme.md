# Intermediate Challenge Rocketseat Explorer - Stage 02

# ðŸ’» About the Challenge

In this challenge, I recreated a landing page based on a ready-made layout in Figma, to reinforce some concepts learned in the Rocketseat Explorer course class, including:

- Structuring an HTML project
- Using most common HTML tags
- Initial CSS concepts
- Element positioning and alignment on the screen
- Applying custom fonts
- Spacings

## Application Layout

The Figma layout is available at this **[link](https://www.figma.com/file/waisYRoNzeBgIxOyrz0b2R/Projeto01-Extra/duplicate).**

You can see the appearance of the application below:
